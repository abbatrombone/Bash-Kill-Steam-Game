# Bash-Kill-Steam-Game
`steamkill` will find steam and should end the process. This is like force quiting in windows. To run it cd into where you have the file (probably Downloads). Then run bash ksteam.sh. The other way is to add this command as an alais to your bashrc file to make it shorter such as ksteam.

`ksteamgame.sh` asks for a game in the terminal and then finds the game and ends the process. This is like force quitting in windows. If it does not find the game it will try to close steam.exe. It will give you a yes or no prompt if you want to kill the process or not.
